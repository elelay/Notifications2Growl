General Information
===================

Notifications2Growl implements FreeDesktop's
Desktop Notifications Specification
(http://galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/index.html) 
by forwarding such notifications to Growl.
Notifications sent using libnotify in your linux apps
will end up as Growl bubles on the screen.

It is based on code from notification-daemon 0.4.0, available from galago-project.org.

Growl (http://www.growl.info) is the major notification framework on Mac OS X.
It provides a framework to post notifications, which is used by this project.

Notifications2Growl takes the shape of a daemon ideally launched upon session startup,
transparently forwarding notifications for linux apps (tested with gPodder).

Installation
============

You're on your own for the moment.
The XCode project links with libraries installed via MacPorts
(http://www.macports.org) :
 - libnotify @0.4.5_0
 - dbus-glib @0.86_1
 - gtk2 @2.20.1_0+darwin_8+no_x11+quartz

I provide the growl application bridge framework from Growl SDK alongside the source.
The complete SDK, including sources, is available from [http://growl.info/files/archive/].
I've chosen version 1.1.6 of the SDK because it's the last version of Growl compatible with Tiger.


How to report bugs & send patches
==================

Disclaimer :
I'm not an experienced Objc/Cocoa programmer,
this is my first dbus/glib program,
I don't do C often.
Sounds like a recipe for disaster !

For the moment, just send me emails (elelay@macports.org).
I also read the gtk-osx mailing list (gtk-osx-users@lists.sourceforge.net).
